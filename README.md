# Abe's Work Day Scheduler

## Description 
[Abe's work-day scheduler]() is an interactive event calendar. It lists today's date at the top. For each hour time block thoroughout the day, the block will be color-coded. The red block (if any) signifies the current time block. Past time windows are colored gray. Time hours yet-to-come are colored green.

For future updates, reducing code reptition would be top priority. Another possible improvement would be to allow the user to enter multiple events which could be stored as an array. This could later be converted back from an array into a list of events within each time hour.

## How It Works

The scheduler user can save an event (which they input as a line of text) by clicking on the "save" image to the right of the time slot. The event will then be saved into the calendar even while the page is refreshed.  

## Usage
This scheduler is intended for the user to be able to create a simple calendar of events to refer to throughout their workday.
